# Admin Panel — AI Assistant Instructions

## What this project is

A multi-tenant SaaS admin panel for small healthcare/wellness businesses.
Built with Clean Architecture, TDD, and strict TypeScript. The Auth
vertical slice is complete. Feature verticals (Services, Appointments,
Clients, Inbox, Dashboard, Settings) are stubs awaiting implementation.

## Critical constraints (non-negotiable)

### TypeScript

- `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` — NO constructor parameter property shorthand.
  Always explicit field declaration + `this.x = x` in the constructor body.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` — use `if (value !== undefined) { this.field = value }`
  for optional fields. Never assign `this.field = maybeUndefined` directly.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` — index access returns `T | undefined`. Always guard.
- `strict: true` — no `any`, ever.

### Architecture

- `domain/` and `application/` must never import React, react-router,
  or anything from `infrastructure/` or `presentation/`.
  ESLint enforces this — do not disable those rules.
- `composition/container.ts` is the ONLY place allowed to construct
  concrete repository implementations.
- Every repository interface method takes `TenantContext` as first param.

### Testing

- Use case tests → hand-written fake repositories
- Infrastructure tests → MSW handlers (real HttpClient code path)
- Presentation tests → fake `AppContainer` via `AppContainerContext.Provider`
- `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'` — every HTTP call needs a registered MSW handler.

### Both must pass before every commit

```bash
npm run test    # all tests green
npm run build   # tsc catches what vitest/esbuild silently ignores
npm run lint    # architectural boundary rules enforced here
```

## Tech stack

- Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 7 (strict)
- Tailwind CSS v4, CSS-variable theming (`src/index.css`) — no `tailwind.config.js`
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives, `src/components/ui/`) + `lucide-react` icons
- React Router 8
- oidc-client-ts (Auth Code + PKCE)
- Vitest + React Testing Library + MSW
- Husky + lint-staged

## Design language

The stock shadcn/ui "Nova" theme, `neutral` base color, unmodified —
no custom brand color, no custom shadows/radius. Light + dark mode,
mobile down to 375px. Full detail — component inventory, the
semantic-token table, icon conventions, mobile checklist — lives in
`.skills/admin-feature-vertical/SKILL.md` (read it before building any
page). The short version:

- Use `src/components/ui/*` (shadcn/ui) exactly as the CLI generates
  them. Don't add props, variants, or styling beyond what a page
  genuinely needs right now — no speculative extensions.
- Style everything with semantic tokens (`bg-background`, `bg-card`,
  `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`,
  `text-primary`, `text-destructive`) — never raw `slate-*`/`teal-*`
  Tailwind palette classes. Tokens are what make dark mode work; raw
  classes silently break it.
- A list of records is a `Table` (`src/components/ui/table.tsx`), not
  stacked `Card`s. A create/edit form always opens in a `Dialog`
  modal, never inline or as its own route.
- Build pages from `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui) and the shared
  composites in `src/presentation/components/` (`PageHeader`,
  `StatusMessage`, `TextField`/`TextAreaField`, `CenteredScreen`,
  `FullScreenSpinner`) — don't hand-roll markup shadcn or an existing
  composite already covers.
- `TagsPage`/`TagForm` is the reference implementation for a CRUD
  list+form page (table + dialog). `AdminLayout` is the reference for
  the page shell, including its off-canvas mobile sidebar — new pages
  don't need their own mobile nav handling.
- All user-facing text is Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) — labels,
  messages, `aria-label`s, confirm prompts. See "Language" in
  `.skills/admin-feature-vertical/SKILL.md`.
- Dark mode is controlled by `ThemeProvider`
  (`src/presentation/providers/`): defaults to the OS preference, an
  explicit toggle (in `AdminLayout`'s sidebar footer) persists to
  `localStorage` after that. Check every new page in both themes.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Never commit `.env.local`.

## Current state (see docs/STATUS.md for full detail)

- ✅ Tooling, Auth vertical, composition root, presentation shell
- ✅ `HttpClient` (`AuthenticatedHttpClient`) — REST features are unblocked
- ✅ shadcn/ui design system, dark mode, mobile-responsive `AdminLayout`
- 🔲 Services → Clients → Appointments → Inbox → Dashboard → Settings
